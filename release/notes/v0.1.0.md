This is the first public release of caddy-paseto! :tada:

The core functionality that I needed is implemented, and it works well from my tests. The code is reasonably well covered (74.72% statements, 1 E2E test).

If you use this, please [report any issues](https://github.com/hackfixme/caddy-paseto/issues). :bow:
